ARIMA Modeling Project for Forecasting Covid Cases <br><br>
Project Overview<br>
This project focuses on learning and applying ARIMA models to forecast Covid-19 case numbers. We will use the auto.arima model, configured with parameters (p,d,q) x (P,D,Q), to analyze the time series data of Covid cases for a specific state.
<br><br>
Model Implementation<br>
Fit the primary auto.arima model to your state's Covid case data.<br>
Explore and fit alternative ARIMA models as appropriate.<br>
Consider using the Holt-Winters model for additional insights.<br>
Model Selection and Forecasting<br>
Average the forecasts from the best-performing model and other viable models selected from the alternatives, utilizing AICC or BIC weights for optimization.<br>
The forecasting period covers from January 1, 2021, to February 10, 2021.<br>
